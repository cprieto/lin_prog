# Programming Linux for Beginners

Many many years ago, I remember my first interaction with Linux Programming was the book [Linux Programming by Example](https://www.librarything.com/work/769889/t/Linux-Programming-by-Example-By-Example) by Kurt Wall. I remember really enjoying that book and it was my entry to the wonderful world of system programming.

This holiday season I wanted to take another look at it and all the things that I learned in that book, hence I took some time to go through the examples again.
